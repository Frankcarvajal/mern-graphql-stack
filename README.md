# A ðŸ”¥ MERN Stack & GraphQL Chat SPA
## MERN Stack = MongoDB, Express, React, Node

MERN full-stack with GraphQL! By the end, I'm going to build a chat SPA with a Node.js server using Express.js, MongoDB database engine, React.js front-end, and GraphQL API back-end.


I will also architecture our GraphQL web service with Apollo Server and Apollo Client v2, and will implement routing with React Router v4.

Developed by Facebook in 2012, GraphQL is a query language and a server runtime for APIs. It is backed up by a spec and comes with official integration libraries for many languages, including JS, and frameworks, such as Express. With its vast open-source ecosystem, GraphQL offers an easily-implementable approach for orchestrating multitier apps with complex API communications. Instead of querying resources with multiple roundtrips in a RESTful API, in GraphQL, you send off queries to a single URL to get back a particular data structure that you need. Forget about under and over-fetching of data. Using a strongly-typed schema, you map out your query requests to any data source that your app has in place, be it a database or a 3rd-party API. With full control over queries, your clients, mobile or web, now exchange data more efficiently, incurring a lesser load on your infrastructure, and tolerating poor network signals.

# MongoDB Dev Setup with mLab

> Note: You can use the docker setup, however I have found it to work best with Ubuntu. For this project I will be using mLab's AWS sandbox db

## Start by going to mlab.com and sign up for login.

## Once logged in select 'Create New' for MongoDB Deployments

## Select Amazon Web Services (AWS) as the cloud provider and Sandbox as the plan type which is free

## Click continue, then once the sandbox db is created under the name of your choosing select your deployment.

## At the top left you will see two commands missing actual login information showing how you can connect to
1) The MongoDB shell, open up a CLI for ex: iTerm or standard Terminal accessing db from any location with the appropriate criteria.
2) Connect using a driver via the standard MongoDB URI (This is what we will use to set our server.js file to connect to the mLab MongoDB database)

## yarn add dotenv at the root of your directory, create a .env file, add .env to your .gitignore file, and in your server.js file add:

```
require('dotenv').config();
```

## In the env file pase SECRET=''

## Next, in mLab interface of the database you created select Users tab and Add database user
Give your user a name of admin or administrator and give it a good password, ensure you do not lose this password or that it is not easily guessed like 'password123'. Ensure that read only is not selected.

## Inside the strings paste the mLab MongoDB URI and replace the <dbuser> and <dbpassword> with the admin user name and the admin password you created. This .env SECRET url will remain private.

## Next, in the Server.js or Index.js file where dotenv was required we connect via Mongoose using our secret env variable

```
mongoose
  .connect(process.env.SECRET)
```



# MongoDB Dev Setup with Docker (Alternative Option)

> Note: could easily use other free 3rd party cloud providers such as mLab or Atlas instead.

```sh
## Start a MongoDB container on port 27017 and create a 'root' user on the 'admin' database
docker run -d --name mongodb -e MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME=root -e MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD=secret mongo

## Run the mongo CLI client on the container as 'root' against 'admin' database and connect to 'chat'
docker exec -it mongodb mongo -u root -p secret --authenticationDatabase admin chat

## Inside the client, create an admin user for the 'chat' database
db.createUser({
  user: 'admin', pwd: 'secret', roles: ['readWrite', 'dbAdmin']
})
```
