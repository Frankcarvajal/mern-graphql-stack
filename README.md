# A ðŸ”¥ MERN Stack & GraphQL Chat SPA
## MERN Stack = MongoDB, Express, React, Node

MERN full-stack with GraphQL! By the end, I'm going to build a chat SPA with a Node.js server using Express.js, MongoDB database engine, React.js front-end, and GraphQL API back-end.


I will also architecture our GraphQL web service with Apollo Server and Apollo Client v2, and will implement routing with React Router v4.

Developed by Facebook in 2012, GraphQL is a query language and a server runtime for APIs. It is backed up by a spec and comes with official integration libraries for many languages, including JS, and frameworks, such as Express. With its vast open-source ecosystem, GraphQL offers an easily-implementable approach for orchestrating multitier apps with complex API communications. Instead of querying resources with multiple roundtrips in a RESTful API, in GraphQL, you send off queries to a single URL to get back a particular data structure that you need. Forget about under and over-fetching of data. Using a strongly-typed schema, you map out your query requests to any data source that your app has in place, be it a database or a 3rd-party API. With full control over queries, your clients, mobile or web, now exchange data more efficiently, incurring a lesser load on your infrastructure, and tolerating poor network signals.

## MongoDB Dev Setup with Docker

> Note: coulse easily use other free 3rd party cloud providers, such as mLab or Atlas, instead.

```sh
# Start a MongoDB container on port 27017 and create a 'root' user on the 'admin' database
docker run -d --name mongodb -e MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME=root -e MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD=secret mongo

# Run the mongo CLI client on the container as 'root' against 'admin' database and connect to 'chat'
docker exec -it mongodb mongo -u root -p secret --authenticationDatabase admin chat

# Inside the client, create an admin user for the 'chat' database
db.createUser({
  user: 'admin', pwd: 'secret', roles: ['readWrite', 'dbAdmin']
})
```
